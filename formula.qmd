Mean service revenue before adopting universal bulk-billing $r_0$

$$
\small
\begin{aligned}
r_0 &= bx + bi + (1-b)x + (1-b)g\\
&= x + g + b(i-g) &(1)\\
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\small
\begin{aligned}
\text{where }b &= \text{proportion of patients bulk-billed concesionally (0-1)}\\
x &= \text{mean service fee}\\
i &= \text{mean individual service bulk-billing incentive}\\
g &= \text{mean gap-fee when patient not bulk-billed with incentive fee}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

Mean service revenue after adopting universal bulk-billing $r_1$

$$
\small
\begin{aligned}
r_1 &= ux + i &(2)\\
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\small
\begin{aligned}
\text{where } u &= \text{ rebates plus quarterly bonus} = 1.125\\
x &= \text{ mean service fee}\\
i &= \text{ mean individual service bulk-billing incentive}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Mean benefit per service ($) of adoping universal bulk-billing

Mean benefit per service of adopting universal bulk-billing $p$

$$
\small
\begin{aligned}
p &= r_1 - r_0 \\
&= x(u-1) - (g-i)(1-b)&(3)\\
\end{aligned}
$$

Implications of equation for $p$ (Equation 3):

* The greater the mean service fee $x$ the greater the mean benefit (per-service) $p$ of adopting universal bulk-billing i.e. $p\propto x$
  + $x$ may increase if longer consult items ('C' vs 'B') are used, or if higher-rebate items are more frequently used e.g. care plans and health assessment.
* The greater the mean gap-fee $g$ increases over and above the mean individual service bulk-billing incentive $i$, the less the mean benefit (per-service) $p$ of adopting universal bulk billing i.e. $p\propto-(g-i)$
  + The mean gap-fee $g$ is less than the 'nominal' gap-fee if the gap-fee is not charged for all relevant services e.g. care-plans, health assessments, reviews.
  + For example, if a nominal gap-fee of 35 dollars is charged for only 50% of services which don't attract a current bulk-billing incentive, then the mean-gap fee $g$ will be 17.5 dollars.
  + The mean individual service bulk-billing incentive $i$ can change with service billing patterns, as some services attract a 'single' incentive of `{r} individual_bulkbill_incentive["1", "single"]` or a 'triple' incentive of `{r} individual_bulkbill_incentive["1", "triple"]` (in Monash Area 1).
    - For example, if a clinic charges more care plans (which attract a single incentive) and less BCDE services (which attract a triple incentive), then $i$ will be reduced.
    - For the 'average' general practice, according to MBS 2024 figures, $i$ is `{r} sprintf("%.2f" ,sum(individual_bulkbill_incentive["1", new_individual_bulkbill_incentive_by_fee] * new_practice_service_proportions))`. For the practice which does - relatively - more care plans and described as 'practice 2' above, $i$ is `{r} sprintf("%.2f" ,sum(individual_bulkbill_incentive["1", new_individual_bulkbill_incentive_by_fee] * new_practice_service_proportions_2))`. 
* As pre-existing bulk-billing (with existing bulk-billing incentives) increases $(b \to 1)$, the less influence the difference between mean gap-fee $g$ and mean bulk-billing incentive fee $i$ have over mean benefit per-service $p$ i.e. $\displaystyle{\lim_{b\to1} p(b) = x(u-1)}$. Conversely, as $b \to 0$, the greater the influence of $(g-i)$ on $p$. 

#### Relative benefit of adopting universal bulk-billing

The *relative* benefit of adopting universal bulk-billing $q$

$$
\small
\begin{aligned}
q &= \frac{p}{r_0}\\
&= \frac{x(u-1) + (i-g)(1-b)}{x + g + b(i-g)} &(4)\\
&= \frac{x(u-1) - (g-i)(1-b)}{x + (g-i)(1-b) + i} &(5)\\
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\small
\begin{aligned}
\text{where } x &= \text{mean service fee}\\
u &= \text{rebates plus quarterly bonus} = 1.125\\
g &= \text{mean gap-fee when patient not bulk-billed with incentive fee}\\
i &= \text{mean individual service bulk-billing incentive}\\
b &= \text{proportion of patients bulk-billed concesionally (0-1)}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

Implications of equation for $q$ (Equation 5)

* As the mean service fee $x$ increases $(x \to \infty)$ then $q \to (u-1)$ i.e. $\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to \infty} q(x) = 0.125}$
* $q$ is quite sensitive to $(g-i)(1-b)$, which appears in both the numerator and denominator, but with opposite signs.
  + $q$ is sensitive to the difference between the mean gap-fee $g$ and the mean individual bulk-bill incentive $i$ i.e. $q\propto-(g-i)$
  + As the gap-fee increases $g\to \infty$ then $\displaystyle{\lim_{g\to\infty}q=\frac{-g}{+g}}=-1$.
  + As the proportion of bulk-billed with pre-existing incentives increases $b\to1$ then $\displaystyle{\lim_{b\to1}q(b) = \frac{x(u-1)}{x+i}}$
  + As the proportion of bulk-billed with pre-existing incentives falls $b\to0$ then $\displaystyle{\lim_{b\to0}q(b) = \frac{x(u-1)-(g-i)}{x+g}}$
